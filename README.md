# SQL Project - Advanced_Database_Technology_Module

A report detailing the SQL/PLSQL database project I designed and built during my MSc degree (all coding is included in the report).

1.	Project Introduction 
1.1.	Project Proposal

In this project, I propose to design a database system for a computer manufacturing firm who allows its customers to configure and build with various different components, custom computers based upon their business/personal needs.  
For example, a customer who is a gaming enthusiast will be able to build and configure a custom pc based upon a range of high performance components such as Video Cards, CPU’s & Motherboards which would suitable to his/her gaming needs.

The main function of the database is to store all order information in relation to each custom pc requested by its customers and also act as an inventory management system for the business as a whole.

I shall start the planning for this project from an early draft of the design concept and then apply techniques such as normalisation and entity relation diagrams to the data in order to find the most optimum and suitable way to break this data into tables.  From there, I shall build the SQL Schema and begin implementing triggers, procedures and functions in order to enable to database to process and store the data as required.  Each of which will be tested to ensure that they perform as expected and desired.

A user base shall also be established, with each role given individual rights and privileges to the database.  The final stage of this project is to build a front end for the database using the Microsoft Access application.  The purpose of this project is to document the development of the initial database concept to a fully functional application capable of performing all functions as required for its business context.
